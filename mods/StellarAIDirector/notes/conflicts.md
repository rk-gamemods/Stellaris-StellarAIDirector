# Stellar AI Director Conflict Notes

## Intentional Conflicts

- `common/ai_budget/zzz_staid_alloys_budget.txt` intentionally replaces the upstream `alloys_expenditure_megastructures` object so late-game megastructure reserves obey Director survival, recovery, prep, and commit gates.
- `common/ai_budget/zzz_staid_gigas_resource_budgets.txt` intentionally replaces upstream Gigas special-resource megastructure budget objects: `sentient_metal_expenditure_megastructures`, `negative_mass_expenditure_megastructures`, and `supertensiles_upkeep_megastructures`.
- `common/economic_plans/zzzz_staid_additive_economic_plan.txt` intentionally adds/overrides `basic_economy_plan` subplans with Director late-game economy, trade-capacity, unlock-research, fleet-throughput, static-defense, and planetary-capacity targets; despite the historical filename, conflict review must treat it as a Director-owned economic-plan surface.

## Expected Additive Surfaces

- `common/scripted_triggers/zzz_staid_decision_state_triggers.txt`
- `common/script_values/zzz_staid_roi_values.txt`
- `common/scripted_triggers/zzz_staid_threat_response_triggers.txt`
- `common/script_values/zzz_staid_threat_response_values.txt`
- `common/opinion_modifiers/zzz_staid_threat_response_opinions.txt`
- `common/on_actions/zzz_staid_threat_response_on_actions.txt`
- `events/zzz_staid_threat_response_events.txt`
- `localisation/english/staid_threat_response_l_english.yml`

## Threat-Response Boundaries

- V1 threat response is diplomacy/readiness pressure only.
- Unknown or unclassified war goals are inert until manually classified and tested.
- Generated threat-response files must not declare wars, join wars, add casus belli, or override diplomatic actions.
- Third-party readiness economy pressure must remain behind `staid_tr_foreign_affairs_safe`.

## NSC3/ESC Design Policy

- Direct NSC3/ESC ship and component design overrides are deferred until observer evidence proves parent AI cannot use the new hulls or components.
- P8 fleet-throughput economy gates provide the v1 usage path without overwriting parent ship/component design logic.

## Review Rules

- Any new full-object override must include an ownership note naming the parent surface and reason.
- Optional-mod references must be omitted or guarded unless the generator proves the referenced object exists.
- Irony conflict results should be classified as intentional Director wins, parent wins required, harmless additive duplicates, unexpected gameplay conflicts, or false positives.

## Irony Analyze Only Review

- Reviewed in Irony Conflict Solver Analyze Only for collection `4.4 Stellaris Mod Collection w/Load Order: NSC3, Planetary Diversity`.
- Existing collection order was preserved; `Stellar AI Director` is the only added local mod and is last after `!!!Universal Resource Patch [2.4+]`.
- Reviewed `common\ai_budget` conflicts: `alloys_expenditure_megastructures`, `negative_mass_expenditure_megastructures`, `sentient_metal_expenditure_megastructures`, and `supertensiles_upkeep_megastructures`.
- Each reviewed object resolves to `Stellar AI Director ... (LIOS)` as an intentional Director win.
- No unexplained Director gameplay conflicts were observed in the reviewed Director conflict set.
